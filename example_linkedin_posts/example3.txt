Software creates workloads
Workloads create traffic
Traffic creates scaling problems
Scaling problems create cloud engineers
Cloud engineers create architectures
Architectures create reliability
Reliability creates happy teams
Happy teams ship more features
More features create more workloads

…and the cycle continues.

If you’re a cloud engineer, you know:
– the only thing more endless than autoscaling groups
– is the number of meetings explaining why something didn’t scale.
